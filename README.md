# App for easy Solana-based real-life transactions

Cryp2p is a Solana-based iOS native app that's focused on improving user experience of real-life crypto transactions. To achieve that, we use QR code system and NFC.

## Groundwork

We're using 
+ [CodeScanner](https://github.com/twostraws/CodeScanner) Xcode package to scan QR codes
+ [Swift.Solana](https://github.com/ajamaica/Solana.Swift) package to handle Solana transactions


## Why?

Because we find painful: 

+ Manipulation with wallet addresses
+ Sending wallet addresses electronically when you're standing next to the recepient


## Funtionality

What can you do with the app?

- Keep track of frequent contacts, adding real names to them
- Make instant transactions with minimal fees with people who are both 2 feet or 2000 miles away
